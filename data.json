You'll meet a boy who turns into a TV set, and a girl who eats a whale. The Unicorn and the Bloath live there, and so does Sarah Cynthia Sylvia Stout who will not take the garbage out. It is a place where you wash your shadow and plant diamond gardens, a place where shoes fly, sisters are auctioned off, and crocodiles go to the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shel Silverstein's masterful collection of poems and drawings is at once outrageously funny and profound.",

      "description": "Did you know that the most creative companies have centralized bathrooms? That brainstorming meetings are a terrible idea? That the color blue can help you double your creative output?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;best-selling author of &lt;em&gt;How We Decide&lt;/em&gt; comes a sparkling and revelatory look at the new science of creativity. Shattering the myth of muses, higher powers, even creative “types,” Jonah Lehrer demonstrates that creativity is not a single gift possessed by the lucky few. It’s a variety of distinct thought processes that we can all learn to use more effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lehrer reveals the importance of embracing the rut, thinking like a child, daydreaming productively, and adopting an outsider’s perspective (travel helps). He unveils the optimal mix of old and new partners in any creative collaboration, and explains why criticism is essential to the process. Then he zooms out to show how we can make our neighborhoods more vibrant, our companies more productive, and our schools more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You’ll learn about Bob Dylan’s writing habits and the drug addictions of poets. You’ll meet a Manhattan bartender who thinks like a chemist, and an autistic surfer who invented an entirely new surfing move. You’ll see why Elizabethan England experienced a creative explosion, and how Pixar’s office space is designed to spark the next big leap in animation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Collapsing the layers separating the neuron from the finished symphony, &lt;em&gt;Imagine &lt;/em&gt;reveals the deep inventiveness of the human mind, and its essential role in our increasingly complex world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://www.jonahlehrer.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;http://www.jonahlehrer.com/&lt;/a&gt;",

Yes, multi-threaded programing is complicated, but Web Workers provide a simple API that helps you be productive without the complex algorithms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have an intermediate to advanced understanding of JavaScript— especially event handling and callbacks—you’re ready to tackle Web Workers with the tools in this example-driven guide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Start creating Web Workers and understand what they can and can’t do&lt;br /&gt;Determine which browser versions support the API&lt;br /&gt;Use dedicated Web Workers for tasks that consume a lot of CPU, such as data parsing&lt;br /&gt;Explore use cases for creating inline Workers, such as encapsulating a web app in one page&lt;br /&gt;Create a shared Worker to communicate multiple web app instances to the server, and other uses&lt;br /&gt;Learn best practices for debugging Web Workers&lt;br /&gt;Apply Web Workers within the server-side Node environment",

      "description": "As a software engineer, you're great with computer languages, compilers, debuggers, and algorithms. And in a perfect world, those who produce the best code are the most successful. But in our perfectly messy world, success also depends on how you work with people to get your job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this highly entertaining book, Brian Fitzpatrick and Ben Collins-Sussman cover basic patterns and anti-patterns for working with other people, teams, and users while trying to develop software. It's valuable information from two respected software engineers whose popular video series, \"Working with Poisonous People,\" has attracted hundreds of thousands of viewers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You'll learn how to deal with imperfect people--those irrational and unpredictable beings--in the course of your work. And you'll discover why playing well with others is at least as important as having great technical skills. By internalizing the techniques in this book, you'll get more software written, be more influential, be happier in your career.",

And there are those who have vowed to destroy it.  In the Valley of the Time Tombs, where huge, brooding structures move backward through time, the Shrike waits for them all.  On the eve of Armageddon, with the entire galaxy at war, seven pilgrims set forth on a final voyage to Hyperion seeking the answers to the unsolved riddles of their lives.  Each carries a desperate hope—and a terrible secret.  And one may hold the fate of humanity in his hands.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the Paperback edition.&lt;/em&gt;",

Packed with the author's original artwork, pop culture references, and most importantly, useful example code, this book teaches functional fundamentals in a way you never thought possible.You'll start with the kid stuff: basic syntax, recursion, types and type classes. Then once you've got the basics down, the real black belt master-class begins: you'll learn to use applicative functors, monads, zippers, and all the other mythical Haskell constructs you've only read about in storybooks.As you work your way through the author's imaginative (and occasionally insane) examples, you'll learn to:Laugh in the face of side effects as you wield purely functional programming techniquesUse the magic of Haskell's \"laziness\" to play with infinite sets of dataOrganize your programs by creating your own types, type classes, and modulesUse Haskell's elegant input/output system to share the genius of your programs with the outside worldShort of eating the author's brain, you will not find a better way to learn this powerful language than reading Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!",

      "description": "With 284 pictures between the book's 533 pages, the book depends equally on its pictures as it does on the actual words. Selznick himself has described the book as \"not exactly a novel, not quite a picture book, not really a graphic novel, or a flip book or a movie, but a combination of all these things.\" The Caldecott Medal is for picture books, in 2008 this was first novel to receive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The primary inspiration is the true story of turn-of-the-century French pioneer filmmaker Georges Méliès, his surviving films, and his collection of mechanical, wind-up figures called automata. Selznick decided to add automata to the storyline after reading Edison's Eve by Gaby Wood, which tells the story of Edison's attempt to create a talking wind-up doll. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Méliès actually had a set of automata, which were either sold or lost. At the end of his life Méliès was broke, even as his films were screening widely in the United States. He did work in a toy booth in a Paris railway station, hence the setting. Selznick drew Méliès's real door in the book.",

      "description": "Il Piccolo Libro di MongoDB è la traduzione autorizzata di The Little MongoDB Book di Karl Seguin. MongoDB è un database NoSQL open source, facilmente scalabile e ad alte prestazioni. Mantiene alcune similitudini coi database relazionali il che, a mio avviso, lo rende un'ottima scelta per chi si sta avvicinando al mondo NoSQL. Il Piccolo Libro è stato scritto proprio per questo tipo di lettore, ma soddisferà senz'altro anche l'esperto che vuole saperne di più su Mongo. Non lasciatevi ingannare da facilità d'uso e giovane età: MongoDB è in grado di soddisfare anche i palati più esigenti.",

Anna has ventured into an unnamed city that has collapsed into chaos and disorder. In this bleak environment, no industry takes place and most of the population collects garbage or scavenges for objects to resell. City governments are unstable and are concerned only with collecting human waste and corpses for fuel. Anna has entered the city to search for her brother William, a journalist, and it is suggested that the Blumes come from a world to the East which has not collapsed.",

      "description": "The Clojure language is a practical alternative for everyday programming that offers expressivity rivaling other dynamic languages like Ruby and Python, but allows you to seamlessly take advantage of Java libraries, services, and all of the resources of the JVM ecosystem. This book helps you learn the fundamentals of Clojure with examples relating it to the languages you know already, in the domains and topics you work with every day. See how this JVM language can help eliminate unnecessary complexity from your programming practice and open up new options for solving the most challenging problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clojure Programming&lt;/em&gt; demonstrates the language's flexibility by showing how it can be used for common tasks like web programming and working with databases, up through more demanding applications that require safe, effective concurrency and parallelism, data and statistical analysis, and more. This in-depth look helps tie together the full Clojure development experience, from how to organize your project and an introduction to Clojure build tooling, to a tutorial on how to make the most of Clojure’s REPL during development, and how to deploy your finished application in a cloud environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Learn how to use Clojure without losing your investment in the Java platform &lt;br /&gt;Understand the advantages of Clojure as an efficient Lisp for the JVM &lt;br /&gt;See how Clojure is used today in several practical domains &lt;br /&gt;Discover how Clojure eliminates the need for many verbose and complicated design patterns &lt;br /&gt;Deploy large web applications across tens or hundreds of cloud nodes with Clojure",

      "description": "They mustn't harm a human being, they must obey human orders, and they must protect their own existence...but only so long as that doesn't violate rules one and two. With these Three Laws of Robotics, humanity embarked on a bold new era of evolution that would open up enormous possibilities - and unforeseen risks. For the scientists who invented the earliest robots weren't content that their creations should remain programmed helpers, companions, and semisentient worker-machines. And soon the robots themselves, aware of their own intelligence, power, and &lt;em&gt;humanity&lt;/em&gt;, aren't either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As humans and robots struggle to survive together - and sometimes against each other - in earthand in space, the future of both hangs in the balance. Here human men and women confront robots gone mad, telepathic robots, robot politicians, and vast robotic intelligences that may already secretly control the world. And both are asking the same question: What is human? And is humanity obsolete?",

Here Almanzo and his brother and sisters help with the summer planting and fall harvest. In winter there is wood to be chopped and great slabs of ice to be cut from the river and stored. Time for fun comes when the jolly tin peddler visits, or best of all, when the fair comes to town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is Laura Ingalls Wilder's beloved story of how her husband Almanzo grew up as a farmer boy far from the little house where Laura lived.",

      "description": "A gargantuan, mind-altering comedy about the Pursuit of Happiness in America set in an addicts' halfway house and a tennis academy, and featuring the most endearingly screwed-up family to come along in recent fiction, &lt;em&gt;Infinite Jest&lt;/em&gt; explores essential questions about what entertainment is and why it has come to so dominate our lives; about how our desire for entertainment affects our need to connect with other people; and about what the pleasures we choose say about who we are. Equal parts philosophical quest and screwball comedy, Infinite Jest bends every rule of fiction without sacrificing for a moment its own entertainment value. It is an exuberant, uniquely American exploration of the passions that make us human - and one of those rare books that renew the idea of what a novel can do. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;",

      "description": "A millennium into the future two advancements have altered the course of human history: the colonization of the galaxy and the creation of the positronic brain. Isaac Asimov's Robot novels chronicle the unlikely partnership between a New York City detective and a humanoid robot who must learn to work together. Like most people left behind on an over-populated Earth, New York City police detective Elijah Baley had little love for either the arrogant Spacers or their robotic companions. But when a prominent Spacer is murdered under mysterious circumstances, Baley is ordered to the Outer Worlds to help track down the killer. The relationship between Life and his Spacer superiors, who distrusted all Earthmen, was strained from the start. Then he learned that they had assigned him a partner: R. Daneel Olivaw. Worst of all was that the \"R\" stood for robot - and his positronic partner was made in the image and likeness of the murder victim!",

      "description": "Every complexity of software design, simplified and codified at last, for use by every programmer, from the novice to the architects of major applications. This book contains the fundamental laws of software development, the primary pieces of understanding that make the difference between a mid-level/junior programmer and the high-level senior software engineer. The book exists to help all programmers understand the process of writing software, on a very fundamental level that can be applied to any programming language or project, from here into eternity. Code Simplicity is also written in such a way that even non-technical managers of software teams can gain an understanding of what the “right way” and the “wrong way” is (and why they are right and wrong) when it comes to software design. The focus of the book is primarily on “software design,” the process of creating a plan for a software project and making technical decisions about the pattern and structure of a system.",

      "description": "Knowledge is a big subject, says Stuart Firestein, but ignorance is a bigger one. And it is ignorance--not knowledge--that is the true engine of science. Most of us have a false impression of science as a surefire, deliberate, step-by-step method for finding things out and getting things done. In fact, says Firestein, more often than not, science is like looking for a black cat in a dark room, and there may not be a cat in the room. The process is more hit-or-miss than you might imagine, with much stumbling and groping after phantoms. But it is exactly this \"not knowing,\" this puzzling over thorny questions or inexplicable data, that gets researchers into the lab early and keeps them there late, the thing that propels them, the very driving force of science. Firestein shows how scientists use ignorance to program their work, to identify what should be done, what the next steps are, and where they should concentrate their energies. And he includes a catalog of how scientists use ignorance, consciously or unconsciously--a remarkable range of approaches that includes looking for connections to other research, revisiting apparently settled questions, using small questions to get at big ones, and tackling a problem simply out of curiosity. The book concludes with four case histories--in cognitive psychology, theoretical physics, astronomy, and neuroscience--that provide a feel for the nuts and bolts of ignorance, the day-to-day battle that goes on in scientific laboratories and in scientific minds with questions that range from the quotidian to the profound. Turning the conventional idea about science on its head, Ignorance opens a new window on the true nature of research. It is a must- read for anyone curious about science.",

      "description": "With the jQuery UI library, you can apply the power and standards of jQuery to user interface design, complete with interactive elements, animation, and themeable widgets. This concise, code-heavy guide demonstrates how to harness interactive features that HTML5 lacks, including tabs, accordions, and dialog boxes. You’ll also learn how to program common but complex tasks, such as managing drag and drop and autocomplete, that make it easier for users to interact with your site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book provides a quick tour of how jQuery UI can improve your HTML pages, followed by standalone chapters that focus on each of the components in detail. If you’re a web developer or designer looking to enrich your website with new features—without having to dive into full-fledged Javascript—jQuery UI is a must.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book covers the following extensions in version 1.8:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tab management&lt;br /&gt;Accordion menus&lt;br /&gt;Dialog boxes&lt;br /&gt;Buttons&lt;br /&gt;Progress bars&lt;br /&gt;Sliders&lt;br /&gt;Date pickers&lt;br /&gt;Autocompleters&lt;br /&gt;Drag and drop management&lt;br /&gt;Selection, resizing, and switching of elements&lt;br /&gt;New visual effects",

Four-year-old Laura lives in the little house with her Pa, her Ma, her sisters Mary and Carrie, and their trusty dog, Jack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pioneer life is sometimes hard, since the family must grow or catch all their own food as they get ready for the cold winter. But it is also exciting as Laura and her folks celebrate Christmas with homemade toys and treats, do the spring planting, bring in the harvest, and make their first trip into town. And every night they are safe and warm in their little house, with the happy sound of Pa's fiddle sending Laura and her sisters off to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so begins Laura Ingalls Wilder's beloved story of a pioneer girl and her family. The nine Little House books have been cherished by generations of readers as both a unique glimpse into America's frontier past and a heartwarming, unforgettable story.",

      "description": "Tired of reading HTML books that only make sense after you're an expert? Then it's about time you picked up Head First HTML and really learned HTML. You want to learn HTML so you can finally create those web pages you've always wanted, so you can communicate more effectively with friends, family, fans, and fanatic customers. You also want to do it right so you can actually maintain and expand your web pages over time so they work in all browsers and mobile devices. Oh, and if you've never heard of CSS, that's okay--we won't tell anyone you're still partying like it's 1999--but if you're going to create web pages in the 21st century then you'll want to know and understand CSS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Learn the real secrets of creating web pages, and why everything your boss told you about HTML tables is probably wrong (and what to do instead). Most importantly, hold your own with your co-worker (and impress cocktail party guests) when he casually mentions how his HTML is now strict, and his CSS is in an external style sheet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; With Head First HTML, you'll avoid the embarrassment of thinking web-safe colors still matter, and the foolishness of slipping a font tag into your pages. Best of all, you'll learn HTML and CSS in a way that won't put you to sleep. If you've read a Head First book, you know what to expect: a visually-rich format designed for the way your brain works. Using the latest research in neurobiology, cognitive science, and learning theory, this book will load HTML and CSS into your brain in a way that sticks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; So what are you waiting for? Leave those other dusty books behind and come join us in Webville. Your tour is about to begin.",

      "description": "&lt;strong&gt;About the Book&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you've seen how dozens of lines of Java or Ruby can dissolve into just a few lines of Clojure, you'll know why the authors of this book call it a \"joyful language.\" Clojure is a dialect of Lisp that runs on the JVM. It combines the nice features of a scripting language with the powerful features of a production environment—features like persistent data structures and clean multithreading that you'll need for industrial-strength application development.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Joy of Clojure&lt;/em&gt; goes beyond just syntax to show you how to write fluent and idiomatic Clojure code. You'll learn a functional approach to programming and will master Lisp techniques that make Clojure so elegant and efficient. The book gives you easy access to hard soft ware areas like concurrency, interoperability, and performance. And it shows you how great it can be to think about problems the Clojure way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchase of the print book comes with an offer of a free PDF, ePub, and Kindle eBook from Manning. Also available is all code from the book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's Inside&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The what and why of Clojure How to work with macros How to do elegant application design Functional programming idioms&lt;br /&gt;Written for programmers coming to Clojure from another programming background—no prior experience with Clojure or Lisp is required.",

      "description": "Conrad Metcalf has problems. He has a monkey on his back, a rabbit in his waiting room, and a trigger-happy kangaroo on his tail. (Maybe evolution therapy is not such a good idea.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He's been shadowing Celeste, the wife of an affluent Oakland urologist. Maybe falling in love with her a little at the same time. When the doctor turns up dead, Metcalf finds himself caught in a crossfire between the boys from the inquisitor's Office and the gangsters in the back room of the Fickle Muse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jonathan Lethem's first novel is a science fiction mystery. It's funny. It's not so funny.&lt;br /&gt;",

      "description": "At least one-third of the people we know are introverts. They are the ones who prefer listening to speaking, reading to partying; who innovate and create but dislike self-promotion; who favor working on their own over brainstorming in teams. Although they are often labeled \"quiet,\" it is to introverts that we owe many of the great contributions to society--from van Gogh’s sunflowers to the invention of the personal computer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Passionately argued, impressively researched, and filled with indelible stories of real people, &lt;em&gt;Quiet &lt;/em&gt;shows how dramatically we undervalue introverts, and how much we lose in doing so. Taking the reader on a journey from Dale Carnegie’s birthplace to Harvard Business School, from a Tony Robbins seminar to an evangelical megachurch, Susan Cain charts the rise of the Extrovert Ideal in the twentieth century and explores its far-reaching effects. She talks to Asian-American students who feel alienated from the brash, backslapping atmosphere of American schools. She questions the dominant values of American business culture, where forced collaboration can stand in the way of innovation, and where the leadership potential of introverts is often overlooked. And she draws on cutting-edge research in psychology and neuroscience to reveal the surprising differences between extroverts and introverts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps most inspiring, she introduces us to successful introverts--from a witty, high-octane public speaker who recharges in solitude after his talks, to a record-breaking salesman who quietly taps into the power of questions. Finally, she offers invaluable advice on everything from how to better negotiate differences in introvert-extrovert relationships to how to empower an introverted child to when it makes sense to be a \"pretend extrovert.\"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This extraordinary book has the power to permanently change how we see introverts and, equally important, how introverts see themselves.",

      "description": "The birth of Jesus has been well chronicled, as have his glorious teachings, acts, and divine sacrifice after his thirtieth birthday. But no one knows about the early life of the Son of God, the missing years -- except Biff, the Messiah's best bud, who has been resurrected to tell the story in the divinely hilarious yet heartfelt work \"reminiscent of Vonnegut and Douglas Adams\" (&lt;em&gt;Philadelphia Inquirer&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verily, the story Biff has to tell is a miraculous one, filled with remarkable journeys, magic, healings, kung fu, corpse reanimations, demons, and hot babes. Even the considerable wiles and devotion of the Savior's pal may not be enough to divert Joshua from his tragic destiny. But there's no one who loves Josh more -- except maybe \"Maggie,\" Mary of Magdala -- and Biff isn't about to let his extraordinary pal suffer and ascend without a fight.",

Relentlessly pushing his own boundaries as a writer—and in the process expanding the boundaries of the entire field—with &lt;em&gt;Embassytown&lt;/em&gt;, Miéville has crafted an extraordinary novel that is not only a moving personal drama but a gripping adventure of alien contact and war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the far future, humans have colonized a distant planet, home to the enigmatic Ariekei, sentient beings famed for a language unique in the universe, one that only a few altered human ambassadors can speak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avice Benner Cho, a human colonist, has returned to Embassytown after years of deep-space adventure. She cannot speak the Ariekei tongue, but she is an indelible part of it, having long ago been made a figure of speech, a living simile in their language.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When distant political machinations deliver a new ambassador to Arieka, the fragile equilibrium between humans and aliens is violently upset. Catastrophe looms, and Avice is torn between competing loyalties—to a husband she no longer loves, to a system she no longer trusts, and to her place in a language she cannot speak yet speaks through her.",

      "description": "With HTML5 applications, developers are faced with new challenges, such as handling offline capable clients, merging data from the client back to their server side storage, and throttling resources based on the device connection speed.

This hands-on introduction shows you how ClojureScript not only has similarities to JavaScript—without the flaws—but also supports the full semantics of its parent language. You’ll delve into ClojureScript’s immutable data structures, lazy sequences, first-class functions, macros, and support for JavaScript libraries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No previous experience with Clojure or ClojureScript is necessary. If you’re familiar with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and the DOM, you’ll quickly discover that ClojureScript has the same reach as JavaScript, but with more power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Start writing ClojureScript code with the Leiningen build system&lt;br /&gt;Learn how the ClojureScript compiler works to produce optimized JavaScript&lt;br /&gt;Use JavaScript functions and libraries directly from ClojureScript code&lt;br /&gt;Explore functions in Clojure’s sequence library such as map, reduce, and filter&lt;br /&gt;Use macros to define new control structures or embed domain-specific languages&lt;br /&gt;Compile manually or script your own workflow with ClojureScript’s compiler tools&lt;br /&gt;Integrate ClojureScript with Clojure on the JVM to build powerful client-server applications",

      "description": "From Star Trek to Star Wars, from Dune to Foundation, science fiction has a rich history of exploring the idea of vast intergalactic societies, and the challenges facing those living in or trying to manage such societies. The stories in Federations will continue that tradition. What are the social/religious/environmental/technological implications of living in such a vast society? What happens when expansionist tendencies on a galactic scale come into conflict with the indigenous peoples of other planets, of other races? And what of the issue of communicating across such distances, or the problems caused by relativistic travel? These are just some of the questions and issues that the stories in Federations will take on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contents:&lt;br /&gt;Introduction / John Joseph Adams --&lt;br /&gt;Mazer in prison / Orson Scott Card --&lt;br /&gt;Carthago delenda est / Genevieve Valentine --&lt;br /&gt;Life-suspension / L.E.

      "description": "If you’re coming from a more traditional object-oriented language such as C++ or Java, JavaScript might seem like it’s not object-oriented at all. After all, JavaScript has no concept of classes, and you don’t even need to define any objects in order to write code. JavaScript can look just as much like C as it can an object-oriented language depending on how you decide to write it. But don’t be fooled, JavaScript is an incredibly powerful and expressive object-oriented language that puts many design decisions in the hands of you, the developer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book is an exploration of the object-oriented nature of JavaScript. It is not specific to a particular JavaScript environment, so it’s equally useful for web developers and Node.js developers. The book includes information about ECMAScript 5 and it’s new capabilities that have changed how you can work with objects in JavaScript.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you'll learn:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• The differences between primitive and reference values&lt;br /&gt;• What makes JavaScript functions so unique&lt;br /&gt;• The various ways of creating an object&lt;br /&gt;• The difference between data properties and accessor properties using ECMAScript 5&lt;br /&gt;• How to define your own constructors&lt;br /&gt;• How to work with and understand prototypes&lt;br /&gt;• Various inheritance patterns for types and objects&lt;br /&gt;• How to create private and privileged object members&lt;br /&gt;• How to prevent modification of objects using ECMAScript 5 functionality",

      "description": "Famine, Death, War, and Pestilence: The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, the harbingers of Armageddon — these are our guides through the Wastelands...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the Book of Revelation to The Road Warrior; from A Canticle for Leibowitz to The Road, storytellers have long imagined the end of the world, weaving eschatological tales of catastrophe, chaos, and calamity. In doing so, these visionary authors have addressed one of the most challenging and enduring themes of imaginative fiction: the nature of life in the aftermath of total societal collapse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gathering together the best post-apocalyptic literature of the last two decades from many of today’s most renowned authors of speculative fiction — including George R.R. Martin, Gene Wolfe, Orson Scott Card, Carol Emshwiller, Jonathan Lethem, Octavia E. Butler, and Stephen King — Wastelands explores the scientific, psychological, and philosophical questions of what it means to remain human in the wake of Armageddon. Whether the end of the world comes through nuclear war, ecological disaster, or cosmological cataclysm, these are tales of survivors, in some cases struggling to rebuild the society that was, in others, merely surviving, scrounging for food in depopulated ruins and defending themselves against monsters, mutants, and marauders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Complete with introductions and an indispensable appendix of recommendations for further reading, Wastelands delves into this bleak landscape, uncovering the raw human emotion and heart-pounding thrills at the genre’s core.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contains the following stories:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Introduction by John Joseph Adams&lt;br /&gt;The End of the Whole Mess by Stephen King&lt;br /&gt;Salvage by Orson Scott Card&lt;br /&gt;The People of Sand and Slag by Paolo Bacigalupi&lt;br /&gt;Bread and Bombs by M.

      "description": "Sauron, the Dark Lord, has gathered to him all the Rings of Power - the means by which he intends to rule Middle-earth. All he lacks in his plans for dominion is the One Ring - the ring that rules them all - which has fallen into the hands of the hobbit, Bilbo Baggins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a sleepy village in the Shire, young Frodo Baggins finds himself faced with an immense task, as his elderly cousin Bilbo entrusts the Ring to his care. Frodo must leave his home and make a perilous journey across Middle-earth to the Cracks of Doom, there to destroy the Ring and foil the Dark Lord in his evil purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it was first published in 1954, The Lord of the Rings has been a book people have treasured. Steeped in unrivalled magic and otherworldliness, its sweeping fantasy has touched the hearts of young and old alike.",

      "description": "The most popular pirate story ever written in English, featuring one of literature’s most beloved “bad guys,” Treasure Island has been happily devoured by several generations of boys—and girls—and grownups. Its unforgettable characters include: young Jim Hawkins, who finds himself owner of a map to Treasure Island, where the fabled pirate booty is buried; honest Captain Smollett, heroic Dr. Livesey, and the good-hearted but obtuse Squire Trelawney, who help Jim on his quest for the treasure; the frightening Blind Pew, double-dealing Israel Hands, and seemingly mad Ben Gunn, buccaneers of varying shades of menace; and, of course, garrulous, affable, ambiguous Long John Silver, who is one moment a friendly, laughing, one-legged sea-cook . . .and the next a dangerous pirate leader!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unexpected and complex relationship that develops between Silver and Jim helps transform what seems at first to be a simple, rip-roaring adventure story into a deeply moving study of a boy’s growth into manhood, as he learns hard lessons about friendship, loyalty, courage and honor—and the uncertain meaning of good and evil.",

      "description": "The key to mastering any Unix system, especially Linux and Mac OS X, is a thorough knowledge of shell scripting. Scripting is a way to harness and customize the power of any Unix system, and it's an essential skill for any Unix users, including system administrators and professional OS X developers. But beneath this simple promise lies a treacherous ocean of variations in Unix commands and standards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;bash Cookbook&lt;/em&gt; teaches shell scripting the way Unix masters practice the craft. It presents a variety of recipes and tricks for all levels of shell programmers so that anyone can become a proficient user of the most common Unix shell -- the bash shell -- and cygwin or other popular Unix emulation packages. Packed full of useful scripts, along with examples that explain how to create better scripts, this new cookbook gives professionals and power users everything they need to automate routine tasks and enable them to truly manage their systems -- rather than have their systems manage them.",

      "description": "Beginning Java 7 guides you through version 7 of the Java language and a wide assortment of platform APIs. New Java 7 language features that are discussed include switch-on-string and try-with-resources. APIs that are discussed include Threading, the Collections Framework, the Concurrency Utilities, Swing, Java 2D, networking, JDBC, SAX, DOM, StAX, XPath, JAX-WS, and SAAJ. This book also presents an introduction to Android app development so that you can apply some of its knowledge to the exciting world of Android app development.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book presents the following table of contents:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chapter 1 introduces you to Java and begins to cover the Java language by focusing on fundamental concepts such as comments, identifiers, variables, expressions, and statements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chapter 2 continues to explore this language by presenting all of its features for working with classes and objects. You learn about features related to class declaration and object creation, encapsulation, information hiding, inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces, and garbage collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chapter 3 focuses on the more advanced language features related to nested classes, packages, static imports, exceptions, assertions, annotations, generics, and enums. Additional chapters introduce you to the few features not covered in Chapters 1 through 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chapter 4 largely moves away from covering language features (although it does introduce class literals and strictfp) while focusing on language-oriented APIs. You learn about Math, StrictMath, Package, Primitive Type Wrapper Classes, Reference, Reflection, String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder, Threading, BigDecimal, and BigInteger in this chapter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chapter 5 begins to explore Java's utility APIs by focusing largely on the Collections Framework. However, it also discusses legacy collection-oriented APIs and how to create your own collections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chapter 6 continues to focus on utility APIs by presenting the concurrency utilities along with the Objects and Random classes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chapter 7 moves you away from the command-line user interfaces that appear in previous chapters and toward graphical user interfaces. You first learn about the Abstract Window Toolkit foundation, and then explore the Java Foundation Classes in terms of Swing and Java 2D. Appendix C explores Accessibility and Drag and Drop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chapter 8 explores filesystem-oriented I/O in terms of the File, RandomAccessFile, stream, and writer/reader classes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chapter 9 introduces you to Java's network APIs (e.g., sockets). It also introduces you to the JDBC API for interacting with databases along with the Java DB database product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chapter 10 dives into Java's XML support by first presenting an introduction to XML (including DTDs and schemas). It next explores the SAX, DOM, StAX, XPath, and XSLT APIs. It even briefly touches on the Validation API. While exploring XPath, you encounter namespace contexts, extension functions and function resolvers, and variables and variable resolvers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chapter 11 introduces you to Java's support for SOAP-based and RESTful web services. As well as providing you with the basics of these web service categories, Chapter 11 presents some advanced topics, such as working with the SAAJ API to communicate with a SOAP-based web service without having to rely on JAX-WS. You will appreciate having learned about XML in Chapter 10 before diving into this chapter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chapter 12 helps you put to use some of the knowledge you've gathered in previous chapters by showing you how to use Java to write an Android app's source code. This chapter introduces you to Android, discusses its architecture, shows you how to install necessary tools, and develops a simple app.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Appendix A presents the solutions to the programming exercises that appear near the end of Chapters 1 through 12.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Appendix B introduces you to Java's Scripting API along with Java 7's support for dynamically typed languages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Appendix C introduces you to additional APIs and architecture topics. Examples include Accessibility, classloaders, Console, Drag and Drop, Java Native Interface, and System Tray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Appendix D presents a gallery of significant applications that demonstrate various aspects of Java.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, there are limits to how much knowledge can be crammed into a print book. For this reason, Appendixes A, B, C, and D are not included in this book's pages. Instead, these appendixes are freely distributed as PDF files. Appendixes A and B are bundled with the book's associated code file at the Apress website (http: //&lt;a href=\"http://www.apress.com/9781430239093\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;www.apress.com/9781430239093&lt;/a&gt;).

What you'll learn The entire Java language, including Java 7-specific features such as switch on string, try-with-resources, final rethrow, multicatch, and SafeVarargs A huge assortment of Java 7 APIs, beginning with those APIs oriented toward the language itself, and including Java 7-specific APIs such as the Fork/Join Framework, Objects, and JLayer Various Java 7 tools, starting with the javac compiler and java application launcher How to create user interfaces, working with web services, and a whole lot more The basics of getting started with Android app development Who this book is for&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book targets the following groups of developers: Newcomers, skilled (to some degree) in other programming languages but with no previous exposure to Java Intermediate Java developers, skilled in the fundamentals of Java prior to Java 7 and looking to increase theirunderstanding of Java 7 language/API changes All developers looking beyond standard Java, who want to leverage Java 7 to create mobile apps via Android Even advanced Java developers may find a few items of interest.

      "description": "&lt;em&gt;The Art of Agile Development&lt;/em&gt; contains practical guidance for anyone considering or applying agile development for building valuable software. Plenty of books describe what agile development is or why it helps software projects succeed, but very few combine information for developers, managers, testers, and customers into a single package that they can apply directly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This book provides no-nonsense advice on agile planning, development, delivery, and management taken from the authors' many years of experience with Extreme Programming (XP). You get a gestalt view of the agile development process, including comprehensive guidance for non-technical readers and hands-on technical practices for developers and testers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Art of Agile Development gives you clear answers to questions such as:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How can we adopt agile development? Do we really need to pair program? What metrics should we report? What if I can't get my customer to participate? How much documentation should we write? When do we design and architect? As a non-developer, how should I work with my agile team? Where is my product roadmap? How does QA fit in? The book teaches you how to adopt XP practices, describes each practice in detail, then discusses principles that will allow you to modify XP and create your own agile method. In particular, this book tackles the difficult aspects of agile development: the need for cooperation and trust among team members.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Whether you're currently part of an agile team, working with an agile team, or interested in agile development, this book provides the practical tips you need to start practicing agile development. As your experience grows, the book will grow with you, providing exercises and information that will teach you first to understand the rules of agile development, break them, and ultimately abandon rules altogether as you master the art of agile development.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; \"Jim Shore and Shane Warden expertly explain the practices and benefits of Extreme Programming. They offer advice from their real-world experiences in leading teams. They answer questions about the practices and show contraindications - ways that a practice may be mis-applied. They offer alternatives you can try if there are impediments to applying a practice, such as the lack of an on-site customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; --Ken Pugh, Author of Jolt Award Winner, &lt;em&gt;Prefactoring&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; \"I will leave a copy of this book with every team I visit.\"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; --Brian Marick, Exampler Consulting",
